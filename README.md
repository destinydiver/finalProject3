# finalProject3

For now, I am not building out this project and I am operating from Angular's front end dev server on default port 4200.
The back end is running on port 3000.

To run you need to have up to date versions installed of:
    a. node.js
    b. express
    c. mongoDB
    d. Angular

1. Start MongoDB by running mongod.exe from admin command line.

2. From "finalProject3" folder, in a second cmd line run npm install by typing "npm install".

3. Change directory in cmd line to angular-src directory by typing "cd angular-src".

4. Now from angular-src directory run npm install by typing "npm install" to install Angular dependancies.

5. While in angular-src directory, run "ng srve" to start the front end @angular dev server.

6. In a third command line, run "nodemon", run back end server and connect to Mongo Database.

7. In browser go to "localhost:4200" for API.  

8. Create a profile by registering.

9. Log into your profile, login will last for 1 hour.

Thanks and enjoy!
