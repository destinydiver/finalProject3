# finalProject3

For now, I am not building out this project and operating from angular's front end dev server.
The back end in running on port 3000.

1. Start MongoDB by running <mongod> in cmd line.

2. In second cmd line run <npm install>.

3. Change directory in cmd line <cd angular-src>.

4. In cmd line run <ng serve> to start the front end @angular dev server.

5. In browser go to <localhost:4200>
